# Verbs

The basic pattern of a fully conjugated, finite verb is _stem-auxiliary-aspect-tense_. For example, **sítsufiral** _was wanting to remove_ breaks down into

| sítsu  | -fi  | -ra            | -l     |
| ------ | ---- | -------------- | ------ |
| remove | want | _imperfective_ | _past_ |

## Aspect

The basic distinction is between:

- the _perfective_, denoted by no suffix
- and the _imperfective_, denoted by a suffix **-ra**. The **r** mutates to **s** after **n**, e.g. **darera** _fight-IMPF_ **mansa** _deceive-IMPF_

A short explanation is that perfective aspect treats an action as an "atomic" _act_, without considering its internal structure, while imperfective aspect zooms in it as a _process_. Consider these two sentences:

**Sáten anba xubun viédul**.\
yesterday I-ERG book read-PAST\
_I read (and finished) a book yesterday._

**Sáten anba xubun viédural**.\
yesterday I-ERG book read-IMPF-PAST\
_I was (in the middle of) reading a book yesterday._

Note that imperfective vs perfective does not map neatly to English _-ing_. English _-ing_ denotes "progressive aspect", which is a subspecies of imperfective aspect that only deals with in-progress actions that have an endpoint.

A more detailed breakdown of aspects by their actual _meaning_ might look like this:

- **Perfective**: Anba xubun viédul. _I read a book._
- **Imperfective**:
  - **Habitual**: Sánen an Tepundoli núxeral. _I lived in Tepundo last year._
  - **Continuous**:
    - **Non-progressive**: Anba datsox kansa. _I see a grocery store._
    - **Progressive**: Anba bulans soþera. _I'm cooking breakfast._

### Secondary aspects

Some secondary aspects are expressed using auxiliaries. This includes the _prospective_ (intention to do something), marked with **-fi** and the _recollective_ (having done something), marked with **-yu**. These auxiliaries then decline _as if_ they are in perfective aspect, but in reality indicates their inherent aspect.

- **Prospective**: Anba xubun viédufil. _I wanted to read a book._
- **Recollective**: Anba xubunni viédugo. _I've read books before_

## Tense

The basic distinction is between:

- the _past_, denoted by **-l**
- the _non-past_, denoted by the lack of a suffix.

The combination of aspect and tense forms a system:

- **Perfective**:
  - **Past**: Anba xubun viédul. _I read a book._
  - **Non-past**: Anba xubun viédu. _I will read/I am about to read a book._
- **Imperfective**:
  - **Past**: Anba xubun viédural. _I was reading a book._
  - **Non-past**: Anba xubun viédura. _I am reading a book._

Note that the _non-past perfective usually denotes a future action_, since it's hard to view a present, incomplete action as an atomic unit.

### Relative tense

Unlike languages like English, tense is _relative_: it's relative to the time of the main clause of the sentence:

**Anba xubun viédurad xahu, Nadaliba mankan dakel.**\
I-ERG book read-IMPF-AT time Natalie-ERG door open.\
_When I was reading a book, Natalie opened the door._

**Anba xubun viédulad xahu, Nadaliba mankan dakel.**\
I-ERG book read-PAST-AT time Natalie-ERG door open.\
_When I had read the book, Natalie opened the door._

The tense in the embedded clause is relative to _when Natalie opened the door_, not to the present.
