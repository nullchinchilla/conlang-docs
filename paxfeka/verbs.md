# Verbs

Verbs in Taaleva are conjugated in a highly agglutinative fashion, structurally reminiscent of Turkic languages. Each verb is built as a linear chain: *root* + *derivation/voice* + *(negation)* + TAM + person/number.

Nonfinite forms don't have + TAM + person/number, and instead have converbs / auxiliaries squished into that place that themselves have the full structure of a verb.

## Root

The root always ends in a vowel: **tado-** *arrive* **tlaha-** *eat* **po-** *go* **messe-** *buy*.

## Voice

The passive is formed with **-vuse**.

The causative is formed with **-raata**.

For instance, **Karlo tadoraatahova.** *I made Karlo arrive*.

## Tenses

The nonpast tense, which forms the citation form, is **-n**. **Karlo tadon.** *Karlo will arrive / arrives*.

The past tense is formed with **-ho**. **Karlo tadoho.** *Karlo arrived*.

## Person/number

The verb agrees in person/number with the subject. This makes pro-drop possible.

- 1sg: **-va**
- 1pl: **-vam**
- 2sg: **-ni**
- 2pl: **-nim**
- 3sg: Ø
- 3pl: **-sa**

**Karlo a Maria tadohosa.** *Karlo and Maria arrived.*  
**Mariad tuuvahe messehovam.** *I bought Maria's bowl.*
