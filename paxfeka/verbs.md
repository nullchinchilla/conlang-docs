# Verbs

The basic pattern of a fully conjugated, finite verb is _stem-auxiliary-person-aspect-tense_. For example, **sísfeðarol** _I was wanting to remove_ breaks down into

| sís    | -fe  | -ða | -ro | -l  |
| ------ | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| remove | want | 1sg | CNT | PA  |

## Person

|       | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | -------- | ------ |
| _1st_ | -ða      | -ðan   |
| _2nd_ | -ni      | -nin   |
| _3rd_ | -ta      | -tan   |

Note that these descend pretty transparently from Mandarin. The only exception is -ða, which formed through analogy to -ðan (咱)
