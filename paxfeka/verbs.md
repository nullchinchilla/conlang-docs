# Verbs

The basic pattern of a fully conjugated, finite verb is _stem-auxiliary-person-aspect-tense_. For example, **sísfeðarol** _I was wanting to remove_ breaks down into

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th>sís</th><th>-fe</th><th>-ða</th><th>-ro</th><th>-l</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>remove</td><td>want</td><td>1sg</td><td>CNT</td><td>PA</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Person

These follow nom-acc alignment, so they agree with the _ergative_ (which may be pro-dropped) in sentences with transitive verbs, not the absolutive.

|       | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | -------- | ------ |
| _1st_ | -ða      | -ðan   |
| _2nd_ | -ni      | -nin   |
| _3rd_ | -ta      | -tan   |

Note that these descend pretty transparently from Standard Chinese. The only exception is -ða, which formed through analogy to -ðan (咱).

(This is _not_ the case for the free pronouns, like **lōra** _you_ and **dara** _you, plural_, which descend respectively from 老家 and 大家. That will be separately treated.)
