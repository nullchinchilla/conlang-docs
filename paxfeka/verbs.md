# Verbs

The basic pattern of a fully conjugated, finite verb is _stem-auxiliary-aspect-tense_. For example, **sísferal** _was wanting to remove_ breaks down into

| sís    | -fe  | -ra            | -l     |
| ------ | ---- | -------------- | ------ |
| remove | want | _imperfective_ | _past_ |

## Aspect

The basic distinction is between

- the _perfective_, denoted by no suffix
- and the _imperfective_, denoted by a suffix **-r(a)**. The **a** drops when phonologically possible, and the **r** mutates to **s** in many positions, e.g. **darer** _fight-IMPF_ **síss** _remove-IMPF_ **mans** _deceive-IMPF_

A short explanation is that perfective aspect treats an action as an "atomic" _act_, without considering its internal structure, while imperfective aspect zooms in it as a _process_. Consider these two sentences:

**Ðuoten anba šubun viédul**.\
yesterday I-ERG book read-PAST\
_I read (and finished) a book yesterday._

**Ðuoten anba šubun viédural**.\
yesterday I-ERG book read-IMPF-PAST\
_I was (in the middle of) reading a book yesterday._

Note that imperfective vs perfective does not map neatly to English _-ing_. English _-ing_ denotes "progressive aspect", which is a subspecies of imperfective aspect that only deals with in-progress actions that have an endpoint.

A more detailed breakdown of aspects by their actual _meaning_ might look like this:

- **Perfective**: Anba šubun viédul. _I read a book._
- **Imperfective**:
  - **Habitual**: Sánen an Tepundomen núšeral. _I lived in Tepundo last year._
  - **Continuous**:
    - **Non-progressive**: Anba datsoš kans. _I see a grocery store._
    - **Progressive**: Anba bulans soþer. _I'm cooking breakfast._
