> They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.

Senmen savolba menō sís-bitad yan sonidenta raš ipašontal.

> Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him;

Yanno, Bebend Fan seðekayta zin seðetal dan, seðetad dašōmen savolba menō šoruntal.

> and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak.

Deho, Bebend Fan fonstal. Yanno, Têyon wanwand zôlankēštal, lìma savolba menō sístal.

> And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
