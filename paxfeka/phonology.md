# Phonology

This describes the phonology of Classical Paxfeka.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The phonology described here is a conservative pronunciation around 500 years out of date, generally used in formal contexts, especially for contexts intended to be intelligible to speakers of different Tepnic languages.

## Vowels

Phonemically, these are the vowels, as well as the standard "textbook" pronunciation:

```
<i> [i]                 <u> [u]

    <e> [e]             <o> [o]

        <æ> [ɛː]

               <a> [a]
```

**æ** is the phonotactically long counterparts of **e**. Many modern speakers pronounce **ē** as [æ], with no significant length difference.

## Consonants

The consonant system is relatively conservative vis-a-vis Paxfeka's Mandarin ancestor. The most notable changes, in historical sequence are:

- restructuring from an aspiration distinction to a voicing distinction
- the merging of the alveolo-palatals and retroflex into the palatal-alveolar
- a series of changes involving rhotacism (generation of /r/) that obliterated all the affricates

|               | Bilabial     | Alveolar        | Postalveolar | Palatal  | Velar        |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| **Nasal**     | \<m> [m]     | \<n> [n]        |              |          |              |
| **Stop**      | \<p b> [p b] | \<t d> [t d]    |              |          | \<k g> [k ɡ] |
| **Tap**       |              | \<r> [ɾ]        |              |          |              |
| **Trill**     |              | \<rr> [r]       |              |          |              |
| **Fricative** | \<f v> [f v] | \<þ ð> [θ ð]    |              |          | \<h> [h~x~ç] |
| **Sibilant**  |              | \<s z> [s z~dz] | \<š> [ʃ]     |          |              |
| **Liquid**    | \<w> [w]     | \<l> [l]        |              | \<y> [j] |              |

\<v> only exists in loanwords, typically from English or vernacular Tepnic languages. e.g. **konvata** "voltage converter", **ivatu** "slang term for radioactive waste (cognate with Classical **wíd fato** 'green garbage pile')"

## Phonotactics

In most cases, the maximal syllable is CVnC, but if V is long, the syllable can at most be CVC.

The last syllable of a word may end in two consonants, the first one of which is not \<n>, and is spelled that way: **mals** "car", **zips** "off-road vehicle".

## Prosody

There is a simple pitch-accent system with two accents: neutral/rising, and sharply falling. The accented syllable is almost always the first syllable.

The neutral accent is unmarked, while the falling accent is marked with an acute accent, or a circumflex accent replacing the macron in the case of a long vowel.
