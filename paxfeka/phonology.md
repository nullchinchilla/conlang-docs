# Phonology

This describes the phonology of Classical Paxfeka.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The phonology described here is a conservative pronunciation around 500 years out of date, generally used in formal contexts, especially for contexts intended to be intelligible to speakers of different Tepnic languages.

## Vowels

Phonemically, these are the vowels:

```
<i> [i]                 <u> [u]

    <e> [e]             <o> [o]

        <ē> [ɛː]        <ō> [ɔː]

               <a> [a]
```

**ē** and **ō** are phonotactically long counterparts of **e** and **o**.

Phonetically, though, there is a series of _nasalized vowels_ \[ã ĩ ũ ẽ õ ɯ̃], but they are best analyzed as representing sequences of sounds with /n/: /an in en on n/, the last one being syllabic.

For instance,

- _Tẽpņfa_ /têːpnfa/ \[ˈtɛ̂ːpɯ̃fa] "Classical Paxfeka"
- _lanhē_ /lǎnheː/ [ˈlǎ̃hɛː] "pelagic zone"
- _Tẽpņdō_ /têːpndoː/ [ˈtɛ̂ːpn̩dɔː] "the city-island of Paxfeka, nominal capital of the planet"
- _lanqo_ /lǎntʃo/ [ˈlǎntʃo] "basketball".

## Consonants

The consonant system is remarkably conservative vis-a-vis Paxfeka's Mandarin ancestor. The most notable changes are the merging of the alveolo-palatals and retroflex into the palatal-alveolar, as well as the straightforward restructuring from an aspiration distinction to a voicing distinction.

## Phonotactics

In most cases, the maximal syllable is CVnC, but if V is long, the syllable can at most be CVC.

The last syllable of a word may _phonologically_ end in two consonants: **malq** "car", but _phonetically_ the cluster is broken up an epenthetic schwa: [malətʃ]. This schwa disappears when unnecessary: **malqad** [maltʃat] "car's"
