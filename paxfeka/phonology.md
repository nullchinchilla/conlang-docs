# Phonology

This describes the phonology of Classical Paxfeka.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The phonology described here is a conservative pronunciation around 500 years out of date, generally used in formal contexts, especially for contexts intended to be intelligible to speakers of different Tepnic languages.

## Vowels

Phonemically, these are the vowels:

```
<i> [i]                 <u> [u]

    <e> [e]             <o> [o]

        <ē> [ɛː]        <ō> [ɔː]

               <a> [a]
```

**ē** and **ō** are phonotactically long counterparts of **e** and **o**.

Phonetically, though, there is a series of _nasalized vowels_ \[ã ĩ ũ ẽ õ ɯ̃], but they are best analyzed as representing sequences of sounds with /n/: /an in en on n/, the last one being syllabic.

For instance,

* _Tẽpņfa_ /têːpnfa/ \[ˈtɛ̂ːpɯ̃fa] "Classical Paxfeka"
* _lanhē_ /lǎnheː/ \[ˈlǎ̃hɛː] "pelagic zone"
* _Tẽpņdō_ /têːpndoː/ \[ˈtɛ̂ːpn̩dɔː] "the city-island of Paxfeka, nominal capital of the planet"
* _lanqo_ /lǎntʃo/ \[ˈlǎntʃo] "basketball".

## Consonants

The consonant system is remarkably conservative vis-a-vis Paxfeka's Mandarin ancestor. The most notable changes are the merging of the alveolo-palatals and retroflex into the palatal-alveolar, as well as the straightforward restructuring from an aspiration distinction to a voicing distinction.

|               | Bilabial | Alveolar | Postalveolar | Palatal | Velar  |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------ | ------- | ------ |
| **Nasal**     | \<m>     | \<n>     |              |         |        |
| **Stop**      | \<p b>   | \<t d>   |              |         | \<k g> |
| **Affricate** |          | \<c z>   | \<q j>       |         |        |
| **Fricative** |          | \<s>     |              |         |        |
| **Liquid**    | \<w>     | \<l>     |              | \<y>    |        |

\<n> is pronounced as velar at the end of a word.

## Phonotactics

In most cases, the maximal syllable is CVnC, but if V is long, the syllable can at most be CVC.

The last syllable of a word may _morphophonologically_ end in two consonants, the first one of which is not \<n>, and is spelled that way: **malq** "car", **jipq** "off-road vehicle".

However whenever these clusters violate sonority, it's pronounced with an epenthetic **a**. So **jipq** is pronounced as if it were spelled "jipaq".

## Prosody

There is a simple pitch-accent system with two accents: neutral/rising, and sharply falling. The accented syllable is almost always the first syllable.

The neutral accent is unmarked, while the falling accent is marked with a grave accent.
