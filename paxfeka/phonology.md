# Phonology

This describes the phonology of Classical Taaleva, which is still taught prescriptively as the standard pronunciation of Taaleva and used in formal contexts.

## Vowels

Phonemically, these are the vowels, as well as the standard pronunciation:

```
<i> [i]                 <u> [u]

    <e> [e]             <o> [o]

               <a> [a]
```

&#x20;/e/ and /o/ are mid vowels, not high-mid.

### Vowel length

There is a vowel-length distinction for /a/ /i/ /u/. Long vowels are written doubled: **taaleva**.

As with Sanskrit, /e/ and /o/ are _inherently long_, due to them originating from diphthongs.

## Consonants

The consonant system is _relatively_ conservative vis-a-vis the Taalic languages' Mandarin ancestor. The most notable sound change, which differentiates Common Taalic from all other branches, are the following interconnected sound changes:

* In all positions:
  * /ʂ/ /ɕ/ /tʂ/ /tɕ/ > /ɬ/ > /l/
* In initial position:
  * /l/ > /n/
  * /pʰ/ /tʰ/ /kʰ/ /tsʰ/ > /p/ /t/ /k/ /ts/
* In medial position:
  * /l/ > /r/
  * /p/ /t/ /k/ /ts/ > /v/ /d/ /ʔ/ /d/
  * /pʰ/ /tʰ/ /kʰ/ /tsʰ/ > /p/ /t/ /k/ /ts/

Thus, a word like **大爆炸 dàbàozhà** comes **taavola** _beginning, genesis_.

|               | Bilabial      | Alveolar     | Palatal   | Velar     | Glottal   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Nasal**     | \<m> \[m]     | \<n> \[n]    |           |           |           |
| **Stop**      | \<p> \[p]     | \<t> \[t]    |           | \<k> \[k] | \<x> \[ʔ] |
| **Tap**       |               | \<r> \[ɾ]    |           |           |           |
| **Fricative** | \<f v> \[f v] | \<d> \[ð\~d] |           |           | \<h> \[h] |
| **Affricate** |               | \<c> \[ts]   |           |           |           |
| **Sibilant**  |               | \<s> \[s]    |           |           |           |
| **Liquid**    |               | \<l> \[l]    | \<y> \[j] |           |           |

## Prosody

The accented syllable is always the first syllable. If the accented syllable in a multisyllabic word is long, it receives a _falling_ accent, and if it is short, it receives a _rising_ accent. This sounds essentially like the equivalent in Serbo-Croatian.

For instance:

**Taalenar axto nos yo.**\
\*大栈-那儿 \*好多 \*老子 \*有\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;here's a lot of people on Taale._\
\[tâː.le̩.nar ǎʔ.to no̩s jo̩]
