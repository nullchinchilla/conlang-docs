# Phonology

This describes the phonology of Classical Paxfeka.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The phonology described here is a conservative pronunciation around 500 years out of date, generally used in formal contexts, especially for contexts intended to be intelligible to speakers of different Tepnic languages.

## Vowels

Phonemically, these are the vowels, as well as the standard "textbook" pronunciation:

```
<i> [i]                 <u> [u]

    <e> [e]             <o> [o]

        <ē> [ɛː]        <ō> [ɔː]

               <a> [a]
```

**ē** and **ō** are phonotactically long counterparts of **e** and **o**. Many modern speakers pronounce **ē** as [æ] and **ō** as [ʌ], with no significant length difference.

## Consonants

The consonant system is relatively conservative vis-a-vis Paxfeka's Mandarin ancestor. The most notable changes are the merging of the alveolo-palatals and retroflex into the palatal-alveolar, as well as the straightforward restructuring from an aspiration distinction to a voicing distinction.

|               | Bilabial     | Alveolar       | Postalveolar   | Palatal  | Velar        |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| **Nasal**     | \<m> [m]     | \<n> [n~ŋ] [n] |                |          |              |
| **Stop**      | \<p b> [p b] | \<t d> [t d]   |                |          | \<k g> [k ɡ] |
| **Affricate** |              | \<c z> [ts dz] | \<q j> [tɕ dʑ] |          |              |
| **Fricative** | \<f v> [f v] | \<s> [s]       |                |          | \<h> [h~x]   |
| **Liquid**    | \<w> [w]     | \<l> [l]       |                | \<y> [j] |              |

\<n> is pronounced as [ŋ] at the end of a word.

\<v> only exists in loanwords, typically from English or vernacular Tepnic languages. e.g. **knvata** "voltage converter" or **ivatu** "slang term for radioactive waste (cognate with Classical **lìsd fato** 'green pier')"

## Phonotactics

In most cases, the maximal syllable is CVnC, but if V is long, the syllable can at most be CVC.

The last syllable of a word may _morphophonologically_ end in two consonants, the first one of which is not \<n>, and is spelled that way: **malq** "car", **jipq** "off-road vehicle".

However whenever these clusters violate sonority, it's pronounced with an epenthetic **a**. So **jipq** is pronounced as if it were spelled "jipaq".

## Prosody

There is a simple pitch-accent system with two accents: neutral/rising, and sharply falling. The accented syllable is almost always the first syllable.

The neutral accent is unmarked, while the falling accent is marked with a grave accent, or a circumflex accent replacing the macron in the case of a long vowel.

## "New" pronunciation

A newer pronunciation attempts to be more based on a compromise between modern pronunciations than historical pronunciation. It has not caught on globally, both due to its ideological connotations (it tends to be more popular among Reunionists), and because it obliterates many distinctions made in smaller dialects. Some notable differences are:

- **z** and **j** after a vowel are generally pronounced **r**, and otherwise merge with **c** and **x**
- **x** pronounced as **h**
- **e ē o ō** are pronounced like **i e u o**, other than in syllables with final nasals.
- **mb** and **nd** clusters tend to be pronounced like **mm** and **nn**.

New-pronunciation _spelling_ was once promoted by the General Council for Reunion during the Panthalassic War, but has largely been abandoned in favor of interoperability with the rest of the world.

**Qemmud harid lodundyanan, tunniya!** _Workers of the whole world, unite!_\
**Qembud xajed lōdundyanan, tunniya!** (trad. spelling)
