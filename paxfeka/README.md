# Phonology

This describes the phonology of Classical Paxfeka (native name _Tẽpņfa_ \[ˈtɛ̂ː.pɯ̃.fa]), a Tepnic langauge that developed as a _koiné_ around 900-1000 that is the second language of the vast majority of Paxfeka's humans.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The phonology described here is a conservative pronunciation around 500 years out of date, generally used in formal contexts, especially for contexts intended to be intelligible to speakers of different Tepnic languages.

## Vowels

Phonemically, these are the vowels:

```
<i> [i]                 <u> [u]

    <e> [e]             <o> [o]
    
        <ē> [ɛː]        <ō> [ɔː]
      
               <a> [a]
```

**ē** and **ō** are phonotactically long counterparts of **e** and **o**.

Phonetically, though, there is a series of _nasalized vowels_ \[ã ĩ ũ ẽ õ ɯ̃], but they are best analyzed as representing sequences of sounds with /n/: /an in en on n/, the last one being syllabic.&#x20;

For instance, _Tẽpņfa_ /têːpnfa/ \[ˈtɛ̂ːpɯ̃fa] "Classical Paxfeka" and _lanhē_ /ˈcaompare _Tẽpņdō_ /têːpndoː/ \[ˈtɛ̂ːpn̩dɔː] "the city-island of Paxfeka" (nominal capital of the planet)
