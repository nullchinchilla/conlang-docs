# Diglossia

Modern Tepnic languages exist in a situation of diglossia with Classical Paxfeka for the vast majority of speakers. Modern forms are heavily influenced by Classical Paxfeka to the extent that they tend to be spelled etymologically rather than phonetically, as if they are Classical Paxfeka but with some novel syntax and vocabulary, and thus are mostly mutually intelligible in writing if not in speech.

For instance, here is a sentence in the vernacular of Dàxondō, one of the largest polities of the planet. A broad phonetic spelling --- used by some clans, especially those aligned to the Reunionist movement --- follows the standard spelling:

**Classical spelling**: _Dōxond jēyofonzal yolan meyoltadyen', jayten soyol meqikayjwa_.\
**Phonetic spelling**: _Nohun ceuforrō yulō myōtanyen, qētē suyō mickerra._\
**Phonetic IPA**: [nɔhun tseu̯fɔrːɔː julɔː mʲɔtanʲɛn tɕɛːtɛː sujɔː mitskerːa]\
**Meaning**: "There's no uranium at the power stations on shore, so today I can't go anywhere".

Note that Dàxondō isn't even a Common Tepnic language, so it cannot be fully explained by sound changes from Classical Paxfeka, but even then Classical spelling is used despite a few irregularities (such as the unpredictability of whether **j** represents spoken **q** or **c**).

In comparison, the sentence in Classical Paxfeka (pronounced as spelled) would be:\
_Dōxond jēyojanl yuleyni me yolta, soy jinten soyodad me qìkayjwa._\
[dɔ́ːʃond dʒɛ́ːjodʒãɫ jǔlejni me jǒɫta, soj dʒǐnteŋ sǒjodat me tʃîkajdʒwa.]

The only really noticeable difference in orthography is the lack of accent marks on the Dàxondō text. This is common to most modern vernaculars, which have entirely lost the pitch-accent system of Classical Paxfeka.
