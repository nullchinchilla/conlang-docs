# Diglossia

Modern Tepnic languages exist in a situation of diglossia with Classical Paxfeka for the vast majority of speakers. Modern forms are heavily influenced by Classical Paxfeka to the extent that they tend to be spelled etymologically rather than phonetically, as if they are Classical Paxfeka but with some novel syntax and vocabulary, and thus are mostly mutually intelligible in writing if not in speech.

For instance, here is a sentence in the dialect of Dàxondō, one of the largest polities of the planet. A broad phonetic transcription follows the standard spelling:

**Spelling**: _Dōxond jēyofonzal yolan meyoltadyen', jayten soyol meqikayjwa_.\
**Pronunciation**: _Nohun ceuforrō yulō myōtanyen, cētē suyō mickerra._\
**Meaning**: "There's no uranium at the power stations on shore, so today I can't go anywhere".

In comparison, the sentence in Classical Paxfeka (pronounced as spelled) would be:\
_Dōxond jēyojanl yuleyni me yolta, soy jinten soyodad me qìkayjwa._

The only really noticeable difference in orthography is the lack of accent marks on the Dàxondō text. This is common to most modern dialects, which have entirely lost the pitch-accent system of Classical Paxfeka.
